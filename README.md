# Accord Project Extension for VSCode

Validate Smart Legal Contracts that conform to the [Accord Project Template Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UacA_r2KGcBA2D4voDgGE8jqid-Uh4Dt09AE-shBKR0/edit)

This VSCode extension parses '.ergo' files using the Ergo parser
and reports any validation errors. It will provide syntax highlighting for template grammar files (.tem) 

Support for model files (.cto) is provided by the [Hyperledger Composer VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HyperledgerComposer.composer-support-client)
